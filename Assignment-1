Assignment:
Human Activity Recognition with Smartphones using Machine Learning  (use suitable dataset and modules like opencv)

Details:

Many of today's mobile devices are designed to automatically detect when we are engaging in a specific activity, such as running or cycling. 
This is machine learning at work. To practice with this type of project, novice machine learning engineers use a dataset that contains fitness activity records for a few people (the more, the better) that was collected through mobile devices equipped with inertial sensors. 
Learners can then build classification models that will accurately predict future activities. This can also help them understand how to solve multi-classification problems.
